To run the php code you have to start apache server using XAMPP/WAMPP(whichever you have installed on your device.)

Save all the files in a folder inside the "htdocs" folder present inside the xampp folder in you C Drive.

Once you have started Apache Server go to your browser and type in :
"localhost/Your Folder Name"
This will fetch all the files and folders present inside the folder that you have specified and then find your file and open it.
